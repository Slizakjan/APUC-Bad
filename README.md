## What Bad means?

> ## ⚠️ Alpha version!!<br>
>  Here Bad means that the code is the first one created, there are some bugs and the code is chaotic inside, so it is hard to add something or update something, also fixing it is clearly impossible. Of course, this is in alpha version, oficiall version will be realsed soon (this is not full version, somethings are missing)
